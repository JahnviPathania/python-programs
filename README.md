# 📊 Python for Data Science: My Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal repository documenting my **daily progress in Python**, with a focus on building the skills needed for **data science and analytics**. This repo is part of my broader journey toward becoming a **data analyst and R&D specialist**, and every file here reflects hands-on learning, experimentation, and growth.

## 🧠 Why This Repo Exists

As a B.Tech student from a tier 3 college, I’m proving that **curiosity, consistency, and clarity** matter more than pedigree. This repo is my way of:
- Practicing Python fundamentals with a data science lens
- Preparing for exams like **AMCAT** and **GATE**
- Building a portfolio that showcases my learning style and problem-solving mindset

Each folder contains chapters with examples, notes, and mini challenges. I update them regularly as I learn.
